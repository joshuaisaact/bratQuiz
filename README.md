# brat or not brat

# a brat summer trivia website

welcome to **brat or not**, a trivia game loosely based on charli xcx's "brat summer" aesthetic. think you know what's brat and what's not? it’s a pretty simple game — just make some quick decisions on random pop culture, lifestyle, and trends. some of it fits the brat vibe, some of it doesn’t. you get the idea.

##### features

- **start the game**: hit the **start** button if you feel like it. you'll get a bunch of random questions.
- **brat or not**: you'll see some noun (could be a celebrity, lifestyle thing, whatever). just decide if it’s **brat** or **not brat**.
- **score tracking**: it keeps track of your score, if you care about that sort of thing.
- **play again**: when it's over, you can start again. or don’t. it’s up to you.

##### how to play

1. **start**: click `start` to begin, if you're ready for that.
2. **make your guess**: for each item, just pick **brat** or **not brat**. not much to it.
3. **see your result**: you'll find out if you're right or wrong. your score updates, if that matters.
4. **next question**: it moves to the next question automatically. you just keep going until it's done.
5. **final score**: at the end, you’ll see your score. if you want, you can play again, or not.

##### game aesthetic

this game has a **brat summer** vibe, i guess. it’s got some attitude, bold colors, and a laid-back style kind of inspired by charli xcx's whole rebellious thing. expect some visuals and prompts. not much else to say.

### game elements

- **nouns**: random stuff like items, trends, or people that are either "brat" or "not brat." you’ll see things like "bic lighters," "taylor swift," or "spicy margs" — and you’ll decide if they’re brat or not.
- **brat**: things that somehow fit the brat summer mood.
- **not brat**: things that don’t really fit in with that vibe.

##### code overview

#### javascript

the game runs on basic javascript, using straightforward DOM manipulation to show questions, take user input, and keep the game going:

- **question array**: all the questions and answers are just stored in an array of objects.
- **event listeners**: buttons are tied to event listeners for handling guesses, moving the game along, and restarting.
- **dynamic updates**: content and background colors change based on whether the guess is right or wrong. pretty simple.

#### css

the design is minimal, styled with CSS to give it a **brat summer** vibe. colors shift during the game — green for correct answers, red for wrong ones.

#### html

the HTML is clean and simple, with a layout that includes buttons and text areas. everything changes based on how the game progresses.

##### future enhancements

- **more questions**: might add more questions at some point for variety, if that matters.
- **voting on answers**: could let users vote on whether they agree with the answers. not sure how much that would change things.
- **create your own brat quiz**: maybe allow users to make their own brat quizzes. could be fun, or not.
